# Machine Learning

This repository provides a summary of the main machine learning processes that can be used in statistical analysis, along with examples of applications in healthcare databases. All the databases shown in this repository are fictional, although efforts were made to include values similar to those found in real databases. Therefore, their use is not recommended for purposes other than training or replicating the results demonstrated throughout the repository.

## Repository Organization:

The software used in each repository is indicated in the title. Due to the inability to create subfolders to organize the repositories for each model, I use a numerical distribution where:

* The first number indicates the machine learning subcategory to which the model belongs.
* The second number indicates the order in which the model was added to the repository.
* The third number indicates the content of the specific repository:
  * A 1 indicates that it contains the code and explanations.
  * A 2 indicates supplemental materials or annexes with additional information about the model.
